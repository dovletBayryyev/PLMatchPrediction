# PLMatchPrediction
Predicting Premier League soccer games using python and the poisson distribution

## 1. Goal
The goal of this project is to predict the outcome of Premier Leauge Soccer games.

## 2. Dataset
There are w datasets used in this analysis.
1. Pl_Home → Statistics for each Premier League team based on their home game results.
2. Pl_Away → Statistics for each Premier League team based on their away game results.
3. matchweek28_games --> Dataset of all matchweek 28 premier league games from 24/25 season.

## 3. Statistical Method used
In this project, I will use the Poisson distribution to predict Premier League match outcomes, since soccer goals are discrete events that can be reasonably modeled as occurring with a certain average rate over a match.

## 4. Technology 
The technology used here is a python notebook with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy

## 5. Conclusion
This model only predicted 5/10 games correclty for matchweek 28 premier league soccer games.
